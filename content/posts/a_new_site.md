After *some time* with WIX site builder, and TheCapyBara trying to rebuild the site, we finally got a new site AND a new blog! 

The site is all written in pure svelte (with the [fluent svelte](https://fluent-svelte.vercel.app/) library), totalling at one page in the export, plus the blog.

The blog is made with hugo (for which I recommend you checking out [this](https://starnumber12046.github.io/post/hugo_first_look/)), the terminal theme and some of the team's time for writing the articles and tweaking some stuff we didn't like in the default configuration

I'm now waiting for someone to expand this article because I don't know what else to put here :)
